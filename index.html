                      <p class="card-text">Phoenixes are a rare, supernatural species that was once thought not to exist. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether or not if the species is a preexisting species or was created specifically by Malivore, Landon's father, since Landon is the only known phoenix. This ambiguity results from Malivore's ability to consume numerous supernaturals as well as gaining the ability to reproduce due to the humans that were thrown into the dimension over time.</p>
